# Repository
This repository includes the raw and filtered datasets for the second version of the monthly CO2 and CH4 fluxes for the Arctic-Boreal terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems (ABCflux v2, building upon Virkkala et al. 2022 https://doi.org/10.5194/essd-14-179-2022).

## Description
We will compile flux data from journal articles, online repositories and contributed by users into a comprehensive and cohesive dataset. In addition to carbon flux data, supporting environmental data will also be collected. In this repository, we document how the data coming from these different sources and from more than 100 northern sites are quality controlled and edited to our common database.
